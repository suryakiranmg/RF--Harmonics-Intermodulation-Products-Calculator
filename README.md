# EE544MiniProject-Harmonics-Intermodulation-Products-Calculator

The purpose of this mini project is to design a “calculator” of Harmonic and Intermodulation components that are generated due to non-linearities of the RF receiver (Particularly Amplifiers). 
It will accept 2 OR 3 input frequencies (in MHz) and generate the Harmonic and IM components separately as outputs. The repeated results both within and across orders are eliminated. Everything is summarized in a way that allows one to determine which transmitters are the most likely offenders. Phantom results are also eliminated.
