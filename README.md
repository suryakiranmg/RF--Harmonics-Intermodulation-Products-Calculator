# EE544 : MiniProject-Harmonics And Intermodulation Products Calculator for Radio Frequency Receivers

The purpose of this mini project is to design a “calculator” of Harmonic and Intermodulation components that are generated due to non-linearities of the Radio-Frequency receiver (Particularly Amplifiers). 

It will accept 2 OR 3 input frequencies (in MHz) and generate the Harmonic and Inter-Modulation components separately as outputs. The repeated results both within and across orders are eliminated. 

Everything is summarized in a way that allows one to determine which transmitters are the most likely offenders. Phantom results are also eliminated.
